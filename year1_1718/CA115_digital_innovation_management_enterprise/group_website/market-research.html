        <h2>Market Research</h2>
        <h3>Market Validation: </h3>
        <p>We have identified our market as the ‘Smart Notebook Market’, with the leading competitor in our space being The Moleskine Smart Notebook which is a Creative Cloud connected sketchbook. It allows you to draw your artwork, capture it with the CC Moleskine app.</p>

        <p>Looking at competitors, this market is somewhat saturated, but in our own opinion is still underserved. Looking at Moleskin’s growth, it rose 13% in 2017. And the CEO Arrigo Berni recently put that down to their ‘investment in digital expansion’. </p> 

        <p>Moleskin, Baron Fig Notebook, Wrights Notes are the leaders and this space. With most of these companies being Venture Backed by U.S VC’s. </p> 

        <p>Considerable VC investment, paired with Corporate Innovation from Moleskin. Leads us to believe that there is opportunity to grow and flourish. </p>

				<h3>Target Market Prioritization &amp; Price Analysis:</h3>

        <p>The above solutions seem to target creatives and professionals, rather than students or business people who may be using this product for day to day writing and note taking rather than sketching and drawing. </p>

        <p>We believe offering a cheaper product and stripping back some features may offer something to students who are looking for an education. Possibly compromising drawing accuracy and other features for a cost effective solution.</p>

				<h3> Audience and Audience Hooks: </h3>

					<p>Using Traffic Analysis from SimilarWeb, we were able to compare traffic sources of 2 competitors. reMarkable, a Smart Notebook that retails for around $500 and Moleskin a traditional notebook company who launched a Smart Notebook last year.

					reMarkable had the U.S as it's primary traffic source, while Moleskin attarcted customers from Europe.

					We were interested to see some the top referral sites were places like UNiDAYS, a popular student discount website. In order to hook our target audience, we believe it'd be effective to target sites such as these to acquire these users. 

					We also believe that Inbound Marketing Tactics, such as blog posts promoting our brand, and sponsored video content on YouTube would be an affective way to keep our user acquistion costs low. 

					For example, there is a popular YouTube Channel that features a 'Productivity' YouTuber called Thomas Frank. His videos focus on Note Taking Apps and other popular ways to study. If we could associate our brand and product with a Channel such as this we could acquire customers while keeping our Cost Per User Acquistion low (CPAC is the amount of money it costs to gain one User / Customer). 

					Learning from other Startups such as Casper (a popular Matress Comapny) going direct to customers should keep our costs low in order to compete with these already established brands. reMarkable and Moleskin pay to be on the High Street and in places like Walmart in the U.S. 

					If we take a completely digital approach selling through our own E-Commerce site and other marketplaces like Amazon. We should be able to pass these savings onto customers, and in turn find out place in the market. </p>
