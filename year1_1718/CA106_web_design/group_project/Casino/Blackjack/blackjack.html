			<h2>Origins Of Blackjack</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The origin of Blackjack, like many other games, has eluded researchers for a long time and  continues to be hotly debated to this day. There has been no clear consensus, but most agree it probably originated in French casinos around 1700, where it was called Vingt-et-Un which, translated, means twenty-one.</p>
			<p>Among the various versions of the game, 'Vingt-et-Un’ or ‘21’ continued to grow in popularity and reach. It gradually spread to North America thanks to French colonists and soon after it was played throughout the continent. The rules of Blackjack were then different from those of modern or contemporary Blackjack.</p>
			<p>The game was still termed ‘21’ when it gained popularity in Nevada in 1931 as the State first chose to make gambling legal. To draw more people to the game, some casinos then offered a special bet: A hand featuring either of the black jacks (the Jack of Spades or that of Clubs) plus the Ace of Spades would pay 10-to-1 odds on the lucky player’s bet. Although casinos later discontinued this peculiar payout, the name ‘blackjack’ remained, as the game is known today.</p>

			<h2>Rules</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Deck</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The standard 52-card pack is used, but in most casinos several decks of cards are shuffled together as a counter-measuere to card counting. The six-deck game (312 cards) is the most popular. It should be noted that there are exceptions in online casinos where far larger numbers of decks can be used than would be practical to manage offline.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Object Of The Game</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21, with a minimum of two cards. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Card Values</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>When playing Blackjack the numeral cards 2 to 10 have their face values, Jacks, Queens and Kings are valued at 10, and Aces can have a value of either 1 or 11. The Ace is always valued at 11 unless that would result in the hand going over 21, in which case it is valued as 1.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3> What's The Deal?</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="ulist">
			<ul>
				<li>Before the deal begins, each player places a bet, in chips, in front of them in the designated area. Minimum and maximum limits are established on the betting.</li>
				<li>Once all the players have placed their bets, the dealer will move their hand across the table from their left to their right signalling that no further bets can be placed.</li>
				<li>The dealer then gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise, and then one card face up to himself.</li>
				<li>Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player, but the dealer takes his second card face down.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Edge Cases</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="ulist">
			<ul>
				<li>If the player is dealt an ace and a ten-card, giving them a total of 21, this is called a natural.</li>
				<li>If a player has a natural and a dealer doesn't the dealer immediately pays that player one and a half times their bet.</li>
				<li>If the dealer has a natural they collect all the bets from the players who don't have naturals.</li>
				<li>If both the dealer and a player have naturals, the player takes back their bet.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>The Play</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt him, or he may ask the dealer for another card. If the player asks for another card and their total goes over 21, they are what's called Bust and the dealer collects their bet.</p>
			<p>If the player considers they have a favourable hand they can choose to 'Double Down'. A player who doubles down receives exactly one more card face up and is then forced to stand regardless of the total.</p>
			<p>Once the dealer has served each player until they are either bust or have decided to stand, his face card is turned up. If the total is 16 or under, the dealer must take another card. If the total is 17 or more, the dealer must stand.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Payouts</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="ulist">
			<ul>
				<li>If the player and dealer have equal unbusted totals the hand is considered a push and the player’s bet is returned.</li>
				<li>If a player wins a hand they are paid out at 1:1 on the total bet wagered on that hand.</li>
				<li>If the dealer's hand is better than the player's he collects the player's bet.</li>
			</ul>
