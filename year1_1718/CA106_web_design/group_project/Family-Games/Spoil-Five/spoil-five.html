				<p>A classic Irish national game. Join with all your family, cousins and especially older family members together into a pub for a few rounds of classic Irish national game - Spoil Five. Also called twenty-five or "Five Fingers". It is said that even It's fast paced, so get your reflexes sharp. Also, a different kind of ranking is used(but don't worry, you can get used to it).</p>

				<h2>How to play</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">
					<h3>Dealing</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The dealer is initially chosen by giving out the deck of fifty-two(52) standard cards to each person until one gets a Jack card. That person will be the first dealer. Deal(distribute) the cards, by two or three. Each player gets five(5) cards. Put the rest of the cards face-down. A card is flipped over from the top - it's the trump suit. The dealing rotates.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				<h3>Game</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>If one player is the dealer or has the ace, then he/she may "rob the trump" at any time of the round.</p>
				<p>The game starts. A player places chooses to place one of the cards from their hand. The others have to "follow suit" - play a card of same suit. Trumps add additional rules which can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoil_Five">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game">here</a>. There's also the concepts of reneging and jinking. It's a complex game so you better as an older family member for instructions! (I swear this is not like 9 minutes until the deadline and I'm writing this) </p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				<h3>Wins</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Players need to take tricks. A player wins a trick who finishes with the highest ranking card. The <a href="#card-ranking">ranking</a> is a bit different.</p>
				<p>A player who takes a trick wins five(5) points. Win one trick or at least three or five. First person to twenty-five(25) points wins the game. (hence where the name comes from). You also should "spoil five" by not letting someone get all the five(5) points.</p>

				<p>Rank and order of cards in black suits when not trumps: K Q J A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</p>
				<p>Rank and order of cards in red suits when trumps: 5 J ♥A A of trumps K Q 10 9 8 7 6 4 3 2</p>
