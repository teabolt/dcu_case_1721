				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Card games are usually associated with casinos and specific groups of people. However, as you will see from the upcoming pages, card games can be extended to include even families and friends.</p>
				<p>Why would you play cards with your family and friends instead of enjoying some other activity? A few reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Since there are so many games available with cards, practically everyone of any age can find something to play. Age excludes no one from card games.</li>
					<li>This activity is almost free once you put an upfront investment into a standard fifty-two card deck. Of course, once you start enjoying the cards your fireplace and juice drink bills may increase as a side effect, but there are more motivation than money for this!</li>
					<li>Bond with your family and friends, having fun together. Most games involve sitting around a table or some other place together, so this is perfect for getting together.</li>
					<li>Play when you want and where you want, easily. The most organisation you'll need to go is getting the whole family together and then cleaning and collecting after the cards afterwards. But there's no in-advance booking, out of places, or anything else that may complicate things.</li>

				<h2>Games</h2>

			<div class="content">
				<p>The four games which will be discussed are "Go Fish", "War", "Rummy", and "Spoil Five"(or Twenty Five).</p>
				<p>These games are traditional and time tested, some even coming from the 16th and 19th centuries.</p>
				<p>Quick summary of the games that will be covered:</p>
				<dl> <!-- A dictionary -->
					<dt>Go Fish</dt>
					<dd>A game most suitable for children. Ask players for cards. Go until all cards in the pool are over.</dd>
					<dt>War</dt>
					<dd>Another youngester' game. You get to go on a war.</dd>
					<dt>Rummy</dt>
					<dd>A more advanced card game that may be more suitable to adult-aged people. Its most prominent feature is the infinity of variations that it holds.</dd>
					<dt>Spoil Five</dt>
					<dd>A game thought to have originated in Ireland and considered to be Ireland's "national card game". Played by many rural pubs. Suitable for older players who may want to recall old memories of playing or try the game for the first time. But younger people can also try out this game.</dd>
