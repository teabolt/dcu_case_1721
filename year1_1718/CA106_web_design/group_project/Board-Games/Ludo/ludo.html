				<div class="content">
					<ul>
						<li> Each player begins with four pieces in their starting area corresponding to their colour. </li>
						<li> To move a piece onto the playing arena, you must roll a six on a standard six sided die. </li>
						<li> Subsequently, each player moves their piece by the amount of squares they roll on a die. </li>
						<li> If a player rolls a six, they have a choice on whether to move six spaces or to bring another one of their pieces onto the playing arena. </li>
						<li> A player who rolls a six also gets another roll however, if they roll a six on three consecutive occasions, they get a foul by a forfeit of their next go. </li>
						<li> A player wins after they have all four of their pieces in the home arena at the centre of the board. </li>
						<li> In order to get a piece in the home arena, a player must roll the exact number needed to enter the arena, if they roll more than needed, the piece begins to move backwards by the amount of extra positions that were rolled on the die. (for example if the last square is 5 spaces away, the player must roll a 5 to get there) </li>
						<li> A player has to take their own colours path to the home arena. </li>
						<li> This game is designed for 2-4 players. </li>
