					<h2> Rules </h2>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<ul>
						<li> Give each player a board with two grids on it. 
						One grid for themselves to mark where their opponent tried to hit and another to mark their where they have either hit or miss their oppenents position.</li>
						<li> Give each player one ship of each type and supply of hit and miss markers. The ships are:
							<ul>
								<li> Carrier with five holes </li>
								<li> Battleship with four holes </li>
								<li> Cruiser with three holes </li>
								<li> Submarine with three holes </li>
								<li> Destroyer with two holes </li>
							</ul>
						</li>	
						<li> The two players sit facing each other with their grids not visible to their opponent so they don't see each others ship locations. </li>
						<li> Each player secretly positions five ships on the lower ocean grid.</li>
						<li> Each ship must be place horizontally or vertically, not diagonally across grid spaces, and they can't hang off the grid space. Ships can touch each other but they can't be on the same space. You cannot change the position of your ships after the games begin. </li>
						<li> This game is designed for 2 players. </li>
					</ul>

				<h2> Basic Gameplay </h2>
			</div>
				<div class="content">
					<ul>
						<li> Players take turns firing shots to attempt to hit enemy ships</li>
						<li> On your turn, call out a letter and a number that identifies a row and column on your target grid. Your opponent checks that position on his corresponding grid and responds with "miss" or "hit" whether a ship was on that position or not. </li>
						<li> Mark each of your shots on your upper target grid using white pegs for a miss or a red peg for a hit to keep track. </li>
						<li> When one of your ships is hit, put a red peg into a hole on that ship on your ocean grid at the location of the hit. When one of your ships has every slot filled with red pegs, you must announce to your oppenent that he has sunk your ship. </li>
						<li> The first player to sink all opposing ships wins the game. </li>
					</ul>

				<h2> Advanced Gameplay </h2>
			</div>
				<div class="content">
					<ul>
						<li> Players who are experienced at playing Battleship sometimes use a variation of the game known as the Salvo variation. The basic rules remain the same with the following exceptions:
							<ul>
								<li> On the first round of the game, you call out five shots and mark each shot with a white peg in your target grid. </li>
								<li> After you've called out all five shots (a salvo), your opponent announces which ones were hits and which ships they hit. </li>
								<li> For hits, change the white pegs on your target grid to red pegs. Your opponent places red pegs in the holes of any ships that you hit. </li>
								<li> Continue in this manner until one of your ships is sunk. At that point, you lose one shot from your salvo. If one of your ships sink, your salvo is reduced to four shots. When two ships sink, the salvo is three shots, and so on. </li>
								<li> Continue playing the game until one player sinks all opposing shipse which results in that player winning the game. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
