							<p>Our natural world is amazing and I hope that this image shows that to you. So many views, and such grandeur to see in this world. Admittedly, I haven't travelled much. But still, seeing the power, complexity and size of the natural world, the earth, other planets, stars, objects and the whole universe, even in images, is worthy of my time. There is nothing else to say. </p><p>Photographer:  Michael Kmet', 'Magic landscape :)'. Uploaded to <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a> as a royalty free image.

						<img src="assets/images/love.jpg" alt="Sunset. Image of two lover's hands touching together as to form a heart, like with a bent fistbump but fingers spread apart. Inside of the heart is the setting down sun. Orange and brown is around it. The edges are shadowy. We can't see the people clearly, only a girl's hair on the left and on the right a man's hand with a watch. Overall, this signifies love.">

                        <p>I'm sure many would agree that one of the most important things in life is love and friendship. And I agree to that too. Maybe love really is or creates the "meaning of life". They can make you happy, give you warm memories, and make your life more than just a cycle of waking and working each day only to go to bed and repeat the same the next day. Making friends, meeting your "special one"(which this image I suppose displays), building a family, and perhaps sadly leaving some people behind are all noteworthy steps in a person's life. As a closure, to paraphrase some quotes, "To love is to vulnerable" and "It is better to have loved and failed than to have never loved at all" </p><p>Picture author: Mayur Gala, 'Love under setting sun photo'.

						<img src="assets/images/screw_gravity_comic.jpg" alt="A humorous web comic about technology/science, with a fat stick figure blaming a box. Five frames from start to end: User hates the program and blames the software developers.  Developer hates the language and blames the language designers. Designer hates the environment and blames the engineers. Engineer hates the circuitry building and blames the physicists for the laws. Finally, the physicist, having no one left to blame, just remarks, 'man, fuck gravity'. End of joke.">

                        <p>I wanted to illustrate that knowledge acquisition and life-long learning are important to me, hopefully not only because I'm currently in university, but also as things that help a person develop throughout life. "Knowledge is power" and all after all. Perhaps this comic does the job. The tree of knowledge has many branches as to say. Innumerably many disciplines are interconnected. And one could make the argument that physics is indeed the very root of all this knowledge, and so is the very root of all our problems.
