I declare that I did not plagiarise any material presented here. External materials such as Internet tutorials, code samples, and other were used for educational purposes only.

If resources used were copied exactly to-the-letter, then this is an acknowledgement and a list, which may not be exhaustive, of them:
Images used came from 'https://imgur.com/' and 'https://unsplash.com/'.
Some fonts came from 'https://fonts.google.com/'.

For tutorial purposes, the following websites have been used extensively. Code was not necessarily copied exactly but rather was used as an inspiration for my own code:
'https://developer.mozilla.org/'
'https://stackoverflow.com/'
'https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/'
'https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties'

Where help was used more considerably, an indication of and a link to the resource in the relevant place is provided in the HTML or CSS comments of the 'index.html' or 'layout.css' files.

In any case where copied material was used but was not acknowledged here, I declare that they were not used deliberately for plagiarism, but were rather simply forgotten.
