			<h2>Origins Of Baccarat</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Baccarat is one of the oldest card games still played in casinos today. It was first documented as early as the 15th century when it appeared in France via Italy. Like many card games, the origins of the game are still hotly debated, however it's believed that Italian gambler Felix Falguerein invented the game. The name baccarat is in fact derived from the Italian word 'baccarat' which quite simply means zero. This refers to the fact that all tens, jacks, queens and kings have a value of zero. The game grew in popularity when it made its way from Italy to France, where it became known as 'Chemin de Fer', and not long after, an offshoot called 'Baccarat en Banque' started. </p>
			<p>For a period of time, the game was exclusive to French nobility, which is why it has traditionally been associated with high rollers. However, it eventually filtered down into casinos and became a popular game amongst many gamblers. The game spread through Europe, and different countries developed their own versions of the popular game.</p>
			<p>America was first introduced to Baccarat in the late 19th century, but the game struggled to gain popularity. From there the game made its way down south to Cuba, where it found a following and a new name, 'Punto Banco'.</p>
			<p>Where punto banco is a game of chance, both chemin de fer and baccarat banque require strategy and skill. Although the odds are still in favour of the banker in these versions. Punto banco is the game played in the majority of casinos, where the casino banks the game at all times and both hands are dealt according to fixed drawing rules. For now on in, when I refer to Baccarat I will be refering to punto banco version of the game.</p>

			<h2>Rules</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Deck</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The standard set up in Baccarat is to use 8 decks of cards in the shoe at one time, but there are sometimes games played with 6 decks. The house edge will change depending on the number of decks used. In general you want to remember two things, the fewer decks that are in play, the better the odds are for you.</p>
			<p>Note: A dealing shoe or dealer's shoe is a gaming device, mainly used in casinos, to hold multiple decks of playing cards. The shoe allows for more games to be played by reducing the time between shuffles and less chance of dealer cheating.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Card Values</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The value of a hand is determined by adding the values of its individual cards.  The hand with the higher value wins; if the hands have the same value, the result is a tie. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="ulist">
			<ul>
				<li>Tens and face cards are counted as zero.</li>
				<li>The numeral cards 2 to 10 have their face values.</li>
				<li>Aces have the value of one.</li>
				<li>Only the last digit of the total is used, so all baccarat hands have values in the range 0 to 9 inclusive.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Banker vs Player</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Regardless of how many people are playing, only two hands are dealt. One is designated the banker hand, the other is the player hand . Any bettor may bet on either hand, with the exception that the customer holding the shoe in the full-scale game must either bet banker or pass the shoe. Do not think of the bank hand as belonging to the house or the player hand belonging to the bettor.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>The Play</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>In full-scale baccarat, the bettor holding the shoe slides one card out and passes it facedown to the dealer, who passes it to the bettor with the largest player bet. The next card, the first of the banker hand, is placed next to the shoe. The bettor then deals another player card, then the second banker card. The dealer calls for the player hand, and the customer with the largest player bet first looks at the cards, then gives them to the dealer. The dealer turns the cards faceup and announces the point total.</p>
			<p>The point totals determine whether either hand gets a third card.</p>
			<p>The player hand is completed first. A total of 8 or 9 is called a "natural," and the player hand gets no more cards. In fact, unless the banker has a natural 9 or ties the natural 8, no further cards are drawn, and the naturals are automatic winners.</p>
			<p>Player also stands on totals of 6 or 7.</p>
			<p>On any other total, zero through 5, player draws a third card, unless banker has a natural, in which case the bank hand wins with no further draw.</p>
			<p>Banker rules are a bit more complex. Banker also stands on 7, 8, or 9 and draws on 0, 1, or 2, but on other hands the banker's play is dependent on the value of the player's third card.</p>
			<p>The Banker draws on a 3 unless the player's third card is an 8, draws on a 4 unless the player's third card is 1, 8, 9, or 10, draws on a 5 only if the player's third card is 4, 5, 6, or 7, and draws on a 6 only if the player's third card is 6 or 7.</p>
			<p>There are a few exceptions. A natural, as noted above, stops play with no further draws. And if the player has one of its other two standing hands, 6 or 7, bank stands on 6 as well as 7, 8, and 9.</p>
			<p>The hand which is closer to 9 wins.</p>
			<p>Ties push, neither hand wins nor loses.</p>

			<h3>Betting</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Winning bets are paid off at even money, 1:1, but a commission of 5% is charged on dealer hand bets making the net odds on such bets 0.95 to 1. Some casinos may charge a lower commission.</p>
			<p>Bettors also may wager that the two hands will finish with an equal number of points. Winning bets on ties pay off at 8-1. That sounds tempting, but this wager carries a hefty 9.5 percent house edge. Avoid it.</p>
