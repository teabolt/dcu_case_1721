			<h2>Origins Of Poker</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The origins of poker are undefined and ambiguous at best. Some believe it has evolved for more than ten centuries from various games, cultures and continents. They claim it is derived from a domino-card game which was first invented by the Chinese sometime before 969 A.D. Other's believe it is a direct descendant of the Persian card game “As Nas,” which dates back to the 16th century. However poker’s closest European predecessors were a French game named “Poque” and a German game named “Pochen”  which both gained popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries. Poque and its German equivalent, pochen, were both based on the 16th-century Spanish game primero, dating back to 1526, which featured three cards dealt to each player and bluffing, or betting high on poor cards. Bluffing is a key component of modern day poker, which is why primero is often referred to as "poker’s mother" as it is the first confirmed version of a game directly related to modern day poker. French colonists brought Poque to their settlements in North America and from there it spread through the country to becomed the game we know today.</p>

			<h2>Poker As We Know It Today</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>There are a plethora of different version of poker. Some of these are very well known and played all over the world, while some are far less common. Naturally, it’s the more popular ones that are typically offered on online poker sites and in casinos and poker rooms. Texas Hold'em is the most played version, with other popular variants including Omaha, 7 Card Stud, Razz and 5 Card Draw. In addition to these versions, a game of poker can also be played in different formats e.g. differences in the amount a player can bet on each hand i.e. pot limit.</p>
			<p>In poker you against other players and not against the house. If a player raises with a bet during a hand you must call/ match that bet to continue playing that particular hand.</p>
			<p>For the sake of simplicity and my own personal sanity I will only be discussing the most popular version of poker played in modern times, Texas Hold'em, from now on in.</p>

			<h2>Rules</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Deck</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Poker is played with a standard 52 card deck.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>The Beginning</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>At the start of the game each player is given a certain amount of chips based on the amount they payed in to play. They will use these chips to bet against other players in order to win their chips.</p>
			<p>When playing Texas Hold'Em poker, every player is dealt two cards face down – these are called your 'hole cards'. Then there is a round of betting where you can Check, Bet or Fold. This stage of the game is known as pre-flop and what you should do is dependent on those hole cards, or starting hand. Checking is when you don't bet but don't fold. If a player bets after you check, you have to either bet or fold.</p>
			<p>When all the betting has finished three shared cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table. This is called the flop.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>The Middle</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>There is another round of betting, then a fourth shared card – called the turn – is dealt.</p>
			<p>There is another round of betting then a final shared card – called the river – and a final round of betting.</p>
			<p>Your best Texas Holdem hands will be made by using your hole cards and the five cards in the middle to make the best possible five card poker hand.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>The End</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>There are two ways a hand can end.</p>
			<p>One is when the players in a hand turn over their hole cards and the player with the best hand wins. This is known as a showdown.</p>
			<p>The other is that someone will bet enough that everyone else folds. This is how most hands end in Texas Hold'em and that's the magic of the game, you don't always need the best hand to win i.e. someone can bluff you off your hand by representing a good hand through the amount they bet.</p>
