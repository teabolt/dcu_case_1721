			<h2>The History Of Faro</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="sub-heading">
			<h3>Origins</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Faro, unlike many other card games, has a well documented history and origin. It descended from a similiar card game called 'basset' after it was outlawed in France in the late 17th century. It first emerged in Southwestern France under the name 'pharaon', during the reign of Louis XIV, shortly after basset was outlawed. Although the French quickly outlawed faro as well.</p>
			<p>Despite it and basset being outlawed in France, pharaon (now called 'pharaoh') and basset continued to be widely played in England during the 18th century, where it was known as pharo. The game was also extremely fashionable in Western Europe during the 18th century. By the 19th century it had spread to the United States and had its name changed to how we know it today, faro.</p>

			<h3>Popularity</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Faro soon became extremely popular in America during the Gold Rush, and in the Old West. Faro was so popular in the 19th century that all other forms of gambling combined couldn’t surpass it.  Faro was the premier game; high-rolling gamblers liked the easy odds, and others enjoyed the quick action and the thrill of staking it all on the turn of a single card. There was no such thing as an honest game of faro in this era. The game was so fair between player and banker that it invited the casinos to take advantage of the game, in order to gain an edge. Cheating was employed  by both player and banker, but to be caught invited gunplay. Early faro cards displayed a portrait of a Bengal Tiger, inspiring such terms as 'bucking the tiger' or 'twisting the tiger's tail' to describe playing the game. You could often find gambling houses that hung a tiger in their window to show that Faro was being played there.</p>
			<p>However, faro became considerably less popular after World War II but you could still find a game in Reno or Las Vegas casinos up until 1985. This is because casinos realised that there was no money to be made for the house through 'honest' faro.</p>

			<h3>The Play</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Any number of people can play at once, within reason, but ten people would probably be the most comfortable. House officals include a dealer, a lookout who looks for signs of cheating and a case-keeper offical who keeps count of cards played. The players place their bets on the cards of their choice using either their betting counters or coppers.  A bet can be placed between two cards or centered at the corners of four cards. If either card of the two, or any of the four, comes up a winner or a loser on a turn, it is paid accordingly. If one should come a loser and the other a winner on the same turn, it is a split.</p>
			<p>The banker first shuffles an entire deck of cards. After this the deck of cards is put into a dealing box. The first card pulled from the dealing box is the soda, which gets burned off, leaving 51 cards in the box. Next the banker draws two cards. The first card is the banker’s card and it’s placed to the right of the dealing box. The second card is a player’s card and it’s placed to the left of the dealing box. Each pair of cards is known as a TURN.There are 25 turns to a game; the SODA and HOCK (the last card turned up) making up the 52 cards of the pack.</p>

			<h3>Betting</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The first card drawn, after the soda card, is the banker's card and is the losing card. Any bets placed on the card of the same value lose and are collected by the banker. Bets placed on the card of the same value as the player's card win, and bettors are paid acordingly (usually one to one). After each turn, all bets settled at that turn are paid and collected. Other bets may remain on the layout or be withdrawn, and new bets may be placed. For instance if you bet on a 2 to appear as the player's card, and it appears as neither cards, then you get either withdraw your bet or leave it for the next turn.</p>
			<p>If two cards of the same rank come up on the same turn, so that a bet on that rank both wins and loses, it is called a split, and the dealer takes half of all bets on that rank. This is the dealer's only advantage in the game.</p>
			<p>A player may bet that a card will be a loser by placing a copper on the top of his stake.This is called COPPERING, as copper coins were originally used.</p>
			<p>When there are only three cards left in the dealing box (banker's card, player's card and the hook), of three different ranks, then the player may bet on the order of them. There are six possible outcomes of three cards, so the odds of winning are one in six. Fair odds would be 5 to 1, but the actual odds pay 4 to 1.</p>
