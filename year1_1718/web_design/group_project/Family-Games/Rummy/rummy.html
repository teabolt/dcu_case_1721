				<p>Ay, cowboy, get your family and friends together. This simple historic game from the United States of America lets you match your cards in an attempt to get rid of those devil's creatures from your hand. Upgrade or "meld" your hand, discarding or taking cards, until you get a set - a "run" of three same suit cards or a set of four same rank cards. This old game has many variations, but we’ll look at the classic on this page.</p>

					<h3>Distribution</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p> The crew, sitting in a circle at their fire, hold up one standard(French - four suits, and card order) deck(collection) of 52 cards. One brave soul chooses to offer his/her hands as the means to parallel true randomness of cards in the deck by shuffling them. But what use are cards that just sit there and do nothing? In the first time, the shuffler walks the extra mile to distribute a select number of cards, usually from ten to six, to each cowboy at the table. How? One card at a time face down, starting with the gentleman or gentelewoman on the left. Cards that remain act as the supplies - the stock, which lays face down. But wait, something's up. The top card turns face up and gets up from the stock and lays next to it. It's the upcard. If that seems like a lot of work for a set up, don't worry. After the first hand's round, if two players play the winner of each round becomes the dealer, and in the case of more, each round the deal passes to the player on the left and so on.</p>

					<h3>Game</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Someone has to make the first move, so the first turn is taken by the sir or madam on the dealer's left. The turns rotate from left to right. As for you, sweat runs down your spine as your turn comes. And the turn's there, and you receive in your hand yet another card; draw from the top card from the stock or take the top card from the discard pile. But the goal is to get right of these damned cards, so you have to make a fatal choice out of two. You can just add one of your cards, face up, to the top of the discard pile. And, wait, hold your boots and horseshoes now player, you can't just cheat and add the same card to the discard pile as the one you just picked from it. As for the second choice, to have an effect that's more than a mere worm to a golden eagle, you can, whose rules ancient spirits of the mountain had set, form a *meld* of multiple cards, laying all of it down face up. A meld? That's a set of matched cards in your hand, either three or four of same suit, or same suit but runs(consecutive sequences) of three or more. And so your turn is over. Yet it comes back again, and you see some melds on the table. You can, indeed, add one or more of your cards to the meld already shown on the table. For instance, when a set of three(3) black cards is laying, you may add a fourth black card to it. If you got 4, 5, 6 before your eyes, you can add 3 or 2, 3 or from the other side 7 or 7, 8.</p>

					<h3>Victory</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Forty five hours and seven minutes later, the game nears its end. A fierce strategiser just matched all the remaining cards in his/her hand, and laying of the melds is done immediately, not waiting until the player discards on his/her last turn. And that lucky fellow or girl that no longer has any cards is the winner...of this round! There are more rounds to go, so calculate your score for this round like this: each numeric card is worth its pip value(the number shown on the card), faces(cards showing a face - J, Q, K) are worth ten points, while the Ace is worth one. Keep track of the score and continue over a few rounds, until one person wins by reaching the maximum score. Now if it so happens during a round that the entire stock has been exhausted with drawings and still no one went out, the next turn's player may decide between taking from the top of the discard pile or turning the pile over and forming a new stock, unshuffled, and so things continuing. On the other end of extremes, a player may go completely "Rummy" by getting rid of all his cards at once, never before in the round having laid off any cards. The points of this madman/madlady are then doubled.</p>

				<h3>Number of players</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>This game works best when there's more than just a romantic couple; more than two people is better. The players can go from 2 to 5 or even more.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				<h3>Card features</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The ranks of the cards remain the same - high to low: K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A. With thy eagle eyes notice that the Ace is low, though it can also be ranked high(settle this deal with your own fellows before proceeding).
				<p>The cards are distributed to each player as follows. For two people, distribute ten cards, for three to four each player gets seven cards, and for five to six give out six cards.

				<p>One simple thing is organisation. Put your cards in order to easier see the melds that they form.</p>
