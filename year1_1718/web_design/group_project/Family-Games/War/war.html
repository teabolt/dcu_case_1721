				<p>This game, if it could be considered to be a game at all, sets you against your loved ones in a battle. It's incredibly simple and so good fun for when you just want to chill without much strategy. Even your children can join in. The aim is to stockpile as many cards as you can. Get all the cards indeed, leaving none to others. Throw your cards down the table and see whose victory it is. This is usually just for two people.</p>

			<div class="sub-heading">
				<h3>Distribution</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Partition a pack of 52 cards or more to each person equally, leaving no cards behind. The dealer, which can be any person, partitions the pack of cards equally to each person, leaving no cards behind. Specifically, the cards are dealt one at a time and face down. Likewise, the players place their stacks face down.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-heading">
				<h3>The game</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p>There are no turns. All at the same time, the players turn up or drop on the table the card at the top of their stack. Then, the player whose shown card has the highest rank(standard, suits ignored) wins the round, and takes all the cards from the table, putting them face down at the bottom of the stack. However, if all the cards happen to be of the same rank, it is war. The players from the top of their stack place one card face down and then one card face up. Who has the highest rank face up card wins and takes all the cards of the round. This procedure repeats when even on the second card turn the cards turn out to be the same. </p>

				<h3>Objective</h3>
