				<h2> Introduction </h2>
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				<p> A board game is a tabletop game that involves pieces or counters and are moved on a pre-marked board according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance, while others are purely based on chance, with no element of skill involved. Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve.</p>
				<p> There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, like Draughts, to having a specific theme and narrative, like Cluedo. Rules can range from the very simple, like Tic-tac-toe, to those describing a game universe in great detail, like Dungeons and Dragons. </p>
