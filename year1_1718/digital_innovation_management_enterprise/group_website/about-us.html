					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>This section of the website is focused on our team and how the Leafpad came to be. Our team consists of five members, Paul, Tomas, Bozhidar, Karolina and Anthony. Each member had his or her part to play in the products overall creation.</p>
					
					<p>After much consideration and brain storming our team came up with the brain child that is, The Leafpad. We contemplated many different products across many diverse areas but as a group of students we began to think about what we might need in our everyday college lives to just ease the load a little. The solution was the Leafpad a notepad that would be reusable, syncable to the cloud and so much more. No more needing to carrying around many copy books and run the risk of losing important notes, all any student would ever need is the Leafpad.</p>

					<p>Our main focus from then on was to try and design our product and convey our idea as clearly as we possibly could. This of course came with difficulties but we hope to continue to diminish any issues we come across and improve on our overall idea.</p>
