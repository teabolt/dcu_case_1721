Title: unions, subsets
Description: Write a function called set_stuff which takes two sets, 
a
 and 
b
 as parameters and returns a tuple with the following elements:
You may use the standard python set functions/operators. This function should be very short.
Your function will be in a file called sets.py
Your function will be tested by the following program:


import sys
from sets import set_stuff

# Function to make a set from a string of tokens
def make_set(line):
    line = line.strip()
    tokens = line.split()
    return set(tokens)
    
def make_sorted_list(s):
    lst = list(s)
    lst.sort()
    return lst
    
def main():
    # Read each set
    line1 = sys.stdin.readline()
    a = make_set(line1)
    
    line2 = sys.stdin.readline()
    b = make_set(line2)

    # call the student's function ...
    union, sub, super = set_stuff(a, b)
    
    # ... and print the result
    # First convert to a list and sort to be sure that the order will always be the same
    print(make_sorted_list(union))
    print(sub)
    print(super)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
