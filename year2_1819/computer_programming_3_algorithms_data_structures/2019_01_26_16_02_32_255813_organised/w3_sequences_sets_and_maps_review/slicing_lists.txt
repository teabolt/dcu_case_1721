Title: Slicing lists
Description: Write a function called get_sliced_lists which will take a list parameter and return the following  lists which should be created using slices:
Your function should put the three lists into their own list and return that. Put your function in a file called numbers.py.
Your program will be tested by the following:
from numbers import get_sliced_lists

def main():
    # read the list from stdin
    nums = []
    num = int(input())
    while num != -1:
        nums.append(num)
        num = int(input())
        
    # call the student's function with the list of numbers and ...
    lists = get_sliced_lists(nums)
    # ... print the result
    for lst in lists:
        print(lst)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
