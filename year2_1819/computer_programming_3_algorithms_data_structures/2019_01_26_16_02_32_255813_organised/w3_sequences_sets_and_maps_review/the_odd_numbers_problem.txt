Title: The Odd Numbers Problem
Description: Write a function called get_odd_list which returns a list of odd numbers. The function should read numbers from standard input until one of the numbers is -1. The function should only add odd numbers to the list. Put your function in a file called numbers.py.
Your program will be tested by the following:
from numbers import get_odd_list

def main():
    # call the get_odd_list function and print the result
    odds = get_odd_list()
    print(odds)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
