Title: The All Numbers Problem
Description: Write a function which will read the input until terminated by -1 and create two lists, one to hold the odd numbers and one to hold the even numbers. The function should return both these lists as a tuple, the odd list followed by the even list.
Put your function in a file called numbers.py.
Your program will be tested by the following:
from numbers import get_evenodd_list

def main():
    # call the get_odd_list function and print the result
    odds, evens = get_evenodd_list()
    print(odds)
    print(evens)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
