Title: Word Lengths
Description: Write a function called get_counts_dict() which will takes a list of words as a parameter and returns a map of a count of each word.
Your function will be tested by the following program:
import sys
from word_length import get_counts_dict

def main():
    # read the list of words from stdin
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    line = line.strip()
    words = line.split()

    # call the student's function
    counts = 
get_counts_dict(words)

    print(type(counts))

    lengths = counts.keys()
    for length in sorted(lengths):
        print(str(length) + ": " + str(counts[length]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Here is an example run of the program:
$ python3 Main.py

this sent ence cont ains only four lett errr words

<class 'dict'>
4: 9
5: 1

In this case, the "sentence" contained 9 four letter "words" and one five letter word (namely words). Use a map to map each word length onto a count.
This is similar to a previous exercise, except that you return a map instead of a list.
