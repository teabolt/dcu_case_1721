Title: Suspicious
Description: A headmaster of a school is contacted by the police and provided with a file of names of juvenile delinquents. He has another file containing the name of his students and wants a program to check if any of the names are the same. Each line of each file contains one name only. Write a program to detect if any name appears on both files. (Example files are shown below) The filenames will be passed to your program on the command line.
Here is what such a program might look like
python3 suspicious.py students.txt delinquents.txt
1. Bob Dylan
2. Boney Vox
3. Shakira

Note that the output is sorted alphabetically. Your program may assume that the files exist.
Here is the students.txt file for this example:
Johnny be good
Boney Vox
The Edge
John Lennon
Shakira
Bob Dylan
James Brown
and here is the delinquents.txt file for that example:
Baddie ThreeShoes
Attila the Hun
Boney Vox
Agolf Hitler
Bob Dylan
Shakira
