Title: Using indices
Description: Write a function called get_counts which will take as a parameter a list of words and return a list of integers which will be a count of the lengths of those words. No word will have more than 9 letters.
For example, if the list of words was ["cat", "dog", "pig", "ability", "babysit", "pat", "bun"] you can see that 5 of the words have 3 letters and 2 of the words have 7 letters, so counts should contain 10 entries with all entries zero except entry 3 which will have a value of 5 and entry 7 which will have a value of 2.
The counts list will be [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0].
On the other hand, if the list of words is ["dog", "pest", "horse", "donkey", "a", "dolphin", "elephant",  "fisherman"], then counts would be [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] as, In this case, there is a single word of every length except 0 and 2.
Place your function in a file called numbers.py. Your function will be tested by the following program:
import sys
from numbers import get_counts

def main():
    # read the list of words from stdin
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    line = line.strip()
    words = line.split()

    # call the student's function and ...
    counts = get_counts(words)
    # ... print the result
    for length in range(10):
        print(str(length) + ": " + str(counts[length]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Remember that the length's list will always have 10 elements regardless of how many words are in the list.
