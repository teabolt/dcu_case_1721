Title: Previous Numbers
Description: Write a program which reads numbers until a -1 is encountered and only print out numbers which have previously occurred in the input. 
Your program will work as follows:
python3 has_previous.py
Enter some numbers (-1 to end): 
45 8 20 7 16 45 0 22 20 6 20 9 -1

Previous: 45 20 20

Note1 that only 45 and 20 (two previous occurances) have occurred before in the input.
Note2 that the numbers in bold are the numbers that the user entered - your program does not print these.
Hints:
print("Enter numbers (-1 to end): ", end="")

num = int(input())

print(str(num) + " ", end="")

print()

Still got output problems ... the previous hints should fix it. However, the output format should match if you have the following code:
    # Do your stuff here
    print("Enter numbers (-1 to end): ", end="")

    # Do your stuff here
    for num in solution:   # assuming solution is a list with the correct results
        print(str(num) + " ", end="")

    print()  # a final print statement to ensure that your output has a newline.
