Title: Intersections
Description: Write a function called set_intersection which takes two sets as parameters and returns the intersection of the two sets.
You may use the standard python set intersection functions/operators. This function should be very short.
Your function will be in a file called sets.py
Your function will be tested by the following program:
import sys
from sets import set_intersection

# Function to make a set from a string of tokens
def make_set(line):
    line = line.strip()
    tokens = line.split()
    return set(tokens)

def main():
    # Read each set
    line1 = sys.stdin.readline()
    set1 = make_set(line1)
    
    line2 = sys.stdin.readline()
    set2 = make_set(line2)

    # call the student's function ...
    intersection = set_intersection(set1, set2)
    
    # ... and print the result
    # First convert to a list and sort to be sure that the order will always be the same
    list_intersection = list(intersection)
    list_intersection.sort()
    print(list_intersection);

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
