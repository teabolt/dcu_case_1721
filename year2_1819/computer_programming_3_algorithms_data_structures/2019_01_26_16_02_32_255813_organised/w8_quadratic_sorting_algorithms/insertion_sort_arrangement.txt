Title: Insertion Sort Arrangement
Description: You just need to arrange some numbers. You will have to submit a dummy program to get the list of numbers and then arrange the numbers and return the numbers as a list of lists.
Given a list of integers show how insertion sort would rearrange the list one pass at a time. For instance, if the list was:
[20, 16, 8, 11, 5, 14]
Then the algorithm would start with the first two elements and place the second element in its sorted position to give
[16, 20]
Then it moves onto the 8 and places that in its sorted position, moving any elements as required:
[8, 16, 20]
next the 11
[8, 11, 16, 20]
next the 5
[5, 8, 11, 16, 20]
and finally the 14
[5, 8, 11, 14, 16, 20]
And you have your insertion sorted list of numbers.
Your task is to do the same thing for a different list of numbers.
There will be 6 numbers and you need to return 5 lists.
 So, if you were given the numbers
[20, 16, 8, 11, 5, 14]
Then your solution should be:
def solution():
    return [
       [16, 20],
       [8, 16, 20],
       [8, 11, 16, 20],
       [5, 8, 11, 16, 20],
       [5, 8, 11, 14, 16, 20],
    ]
What is your number? Submit a solution that returns an empty list and you will get your list of 6 numbers. In other words, submit
def solution():
    return []
and you will get a message similar to
Your list is:
[20, 16, 8, 11, 5, 14]
Note however, your list will be different. Then work out the solution and submit the appropriate lists and get full marks.
