Title: Selection Sort Stats
Description: """ Selection sort algorithm """
def selection_sort(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Find the smallest item in the lst starting at i
        min_index = i
        for j in range(min_index + 1, len(lst)):
            if lst[j] < lst[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        # place smallest at the beginning (swap min index with i)
        lst[i], lst[min_index] = lst[min_index], lst[i]

Count the number of compares and the number of moves that this algorithm executes for the input lst.
Note that each swap counts as three moves.
Your code will be tested by the following program:
import sys
from selection_sort import selection_sort

def main():
    # Read each test case
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    items = line.strip().split()
    
    orig = list(items)

    result = selection_sort(items)
    if items != sorted(orig):
        print("The list is not sorted.")
    else:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
