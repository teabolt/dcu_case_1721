Title: Plurals
Description: NB Problem taken from Darragh O'Brien
Define a function called get_plural(). The function should have one parameter which is a word (a noun) and the function should return the plural of the word based on the following rules:
Your program only has to define the function. An example usage is as follows:
plural = get_plural("beach")

When executed, plural will have the value "beaches".
Your function will be tested using a program similar to the following:
import sys
from word import get_plural

def check(word, plural):
    return 1 # if the plural is correct or 0 otherwise.

words = ["beach", "fish", "fox", "bus", "fez", "potato", "fairy", "lady", "boy", "elf", "knife", "fog", "tissue"]

num_correct = 0
for word in words:
    num_correct += check(word, get_plural(word))

print("All Good" if num_correct == len(words) else str(len(words) - num_correct) + " incorrect.")
