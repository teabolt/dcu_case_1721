Title: Average a list
Description: Define a function called calc_average() in a python program. The function should have one parameter which is a list of integers and should return a single value which is the average of the integers in the list.
Your program only has to define the function and might look like
def calc_average(numbers):
   sum = sum(numbers)
   return sum

Note that this code is not correct. It will have to be adapted if you wish to receive marks.
Your function will be tested using the following code:
import sys
from average import calc_average # student's function

#
#   Read a list from stdin
#
line = sys.stdin.readline()

tokens = line.split()

list = []

for token in tokens:
    list.append(int(token))

#
#   Call the function + print result
#
print(calc_average(list))
