Title: Sum of two elements
Description: Write a python function which takes two parameters, a list of integers and a number, k, and which prints every pair of numbers in the list which add up to k.
The function would work as follows:
   lst = [60, 6, 10, 8, 5]
   k = 15
   
sum_to_k(lst, k)


This will print
10 5
as these are the only two numbers which add up to 15. Here is another example:
lst = [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 13
sum_to_k(lst, k)

will print
6 7
8 5
9 4
10 3

In the event that no such pair of elements sum to k, then your program should print nothing.
You should use an O(n
2
) algorithm in your solution. Your function should be called sum_to_k(), should take two parameters.
