Title: Above Average
Description: Define a function called above_average(). The function should have one parameter which is a list of integers and should return a new list which is all the elements of the original list which are larger than the average.
Your program only has to define the function. An example usage is as follows:
l = above_average([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2])

When executed, the list 
l
 will contain only one element, 2, since only 2 is larger than the average.
Your function will be tested using the following program:
import sys
from average import above_average

#
#   Read a list from stdin
#
line = sys.stdin.readline()

tokens = line.split()

list = []

for tok in tokens:
    list.append(int(tok))

#
#   Call the function + print result
#
print(above_average(list))
