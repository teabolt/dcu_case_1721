Title: Recursive Print
Description: Write a recursive function called rprint to print a range of integers from a to b.
This function could easily and sensibly be implemented using the following:
def rprint(a, b):
   for x in range(a, b):
      print(x)

Assuming that 
a
 had the value 4 and 
b
 had the value 10 then the function would print
4
5
6
7
8
9

However, you won't be using a loop. You'll use recursion to accomplish this. Your function might be used by the following program:
from recursive_print import rprint

def main():
    # Read two integers from stdin
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    # Call rprint which should recursively print a..b-1
    rprint(a, b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
