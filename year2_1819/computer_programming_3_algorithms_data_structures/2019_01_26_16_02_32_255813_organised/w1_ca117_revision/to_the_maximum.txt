Title: To the maximum
Description: Write a recursive function called maximum() which will find the maximum value in a list of integers. You may assume that the list contains at least one element.
This function could easily and sensibly be implemented using the following:
def maximum(lst):
    return max(lst)

However, you should not use the built-in max function or any loop construct. You should implement a recursive solution
Your program will be tested by the following program:
#
#   Program to check a student's maximum function.
#
import sys
from recursive_max import maximum

# Read in a list from a string of numbers
def get_list(line):
   tokens = line.split()
   # convert the tokens to integers (using a list comprehension)
   return [int(tok) for tok in tokens]

def main():
   line = sys.stdin.readline()
   # remove end of line
   line = line.strip()
   # Convert to a list
   nums = get_list(line)

   # call recursive function to get max of the list.
   print(maximum(nums))

if __name__ == "__main__":
   main()

Note: you may use the following function to get the larger of two numbers:
def maxi(a, b):
   if a >= b:
      return a
   else:
      return b

Remember that you can't use the built-in max() function for this.
