Title: SumTo
Description: Write a recursive function called sumto() which will compute the sum of a range of integers from a to b (including a but not including b).
This function could easily and sensibly be implemented using the following:
def sumto(a, b):
    sum = 0
    for x in range(a, b):
        sum += x
    return sum

Assuming that 
a
 had the value 4 and 
b
 had the value 7 then the function would return 15, the sum of the integers 4, 5 and 6.
An implementation could also use the sum function as follows:
def sumto(a, b):
    return sum(list(range(a, b)))

However, your implementation should not use a loop or the sum function. Instead, you should use recursion. Your program might be tested by the following program:
from recursive_sum import sumto

def main():
    # Read two integers from stdin
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    # Call sumto which should recursively sum the integers from a to b-1
    print(sumto(a, b))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
