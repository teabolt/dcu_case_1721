Title: Evil Count List
Description: Write an even_count function which takes a linked list of integers as an argument and counts the number of even elements in the list
Note that this exercise does not require you to add a method to a linked list. Instead, write a function that takes a linked list as a parameter. You only need to supply the even_count method.
Your method will be tested by the following program:
import sys
from LinkedList import LinkedList
from even_count_list import even_count

def main():
    # Read each set
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    items = line.strip().split()
    nums = [int(item) for item in items]
    
    ll = LinkedList()
    
    for num in nums:
        ll.add(num)
    
    print(
even_count(ll)
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
