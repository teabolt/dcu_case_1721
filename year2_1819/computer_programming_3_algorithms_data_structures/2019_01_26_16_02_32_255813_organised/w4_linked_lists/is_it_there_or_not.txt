Title: Is it there or not
Description: Add a contains method to the LinkedList class which returns true if its argument is contained in the list. It should leave the list unchanged.The LinkedList class is as in the previous question:
Your method will be tested by the following program:


import sys
from LinkedList import LinkedList

def main():
    # Read each line
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    items = line.strip().split()
    
    ll = LinkedList()
    problem = False
    if ll.contains(items[0]):
        print("An empty list should not match anything")
        problem = True
    
    else:
        for item in items:
            if ll.contains(item):
                print(item + " detected before being added.")
                problem = True
            ll.add(item)
            
        # Now every item in the items should be in the list.
        for item in items:
            if not ll.contains(item): # item should not be contained
                print(item + " not found in list.")
                problem = True

    if not problem:
        # check that the list still contains all the items
        while not ll.is_empty() and len(items) > 0:
            if ll.remove() != items.pop():
                print("List has been modified")
                problem = true
                break
        
        if not problem:
            if (not ll.is_empty()) or len(items) != 0:
                print("the list size is wrong");
                problem = True
                
    if problem:
        print("More work needed!")
    else:
        print("all ok!")
