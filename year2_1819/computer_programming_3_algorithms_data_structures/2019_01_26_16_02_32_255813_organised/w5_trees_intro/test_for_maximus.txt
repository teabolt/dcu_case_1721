Title: Test for Maximus
Description: We will define a Maximal Tree as one which for a given height as as many nodes as possible - that is, every row is full. You are to create a function which will have a BST as argument and will determine if the tree is maximal. Your function should be called is_maximal().
The input will be generated programatically. Your function will be tested by code similar to the following:
from student import is_maximal

def test(lst):
    bst = BST()

    # Add each element in the lst to the tree
    for n in lst:
        bst.add(n)

    # Print the list and whether or not the resulting tree is maximal
    print("bst.is_maximal(" + str(lst) + ") is " + str(
is_maximal(bst)
))
