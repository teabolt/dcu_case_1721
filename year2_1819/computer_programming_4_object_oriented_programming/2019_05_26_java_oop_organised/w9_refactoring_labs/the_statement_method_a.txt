Title: The statement method (A)
Description: Add a the statement method to the Customer class. It should produce the same output as the method in the book (page 15 and 16).Â 
However, you should not use the code that is in the book. That code was written in prehistoric times and, now, no one would use a Vector or an Enumeration. In fact, you should pretend that you don't even know what those classes are. Instead, use a List class and use the foreach method to go through each Rental. Also, be sure to use generics to create a List of type Rental.
Note also that tabs cannot be properly marked, so replace all tabs with two spaces. And your String should be terminated by a newline.
Your class will be tested by the following program.
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
       Movie [] movies = { new Movie("James Bond does Java", Movie.NEW_RELEASE), new Movie("Mickey Mouse", Movie.CHILDRENS), new Movie("The Pointer Sisters", Movie.REGULAR)};
       Rental [] rentalsArray = { new Rental(movies[0], 1), new Rental(movies[1], 10), new Rental(movies[2], 2)};
       
       List<Rental> rentals = new ArrayList<Rental>(Arrays.asList(rentalsArray));
       
       Customer donald = new Customer("Donald", rentals);
       
       System.out.println(donald.getName());
       System.out.println(donald.getRentals());
       System.out.println(donald); // test the toString() method.
       
       System.out.println("\nYour statement:");
       System.out.print(donald.statement());
   }
}
