Title: How many fives?
Description: Write a static method which takes as a parameter an integer array and which returns the number of the elements in the array which are exactly 5. Put the method in a Test class
Your method would be called as follows
   int [] num = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 5, 0, -5, 5};
   // Call the method to count the fives
   int result = Test.countFives(num);
   // There are three fives in this array, so result will have a value of 3. (If the countFives method works)
