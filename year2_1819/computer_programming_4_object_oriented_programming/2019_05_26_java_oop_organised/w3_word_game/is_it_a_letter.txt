Title: Is it a letter?
Description: Write a method called containsLetter which takes as parameters a word and a letter and returns true if the word contains the letter and false if it doesn't.
The method should be a static method of a Word class and could be used as shown in the following program (see section in bold):


import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestContainsLetter
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Ask the user for a word and a letter
        System.out.print("Enter a word and a letter: ");
        String word = in.next();
        char letter = in.next().charAt(0);
        
        if(
Word.containsLetter(word, letter)
)
            System.out.println(letter + " is in " + word);
        else
            System.out.println(letter + " is not in " + word);
    }
}
And the program would be executed as follows:

$ java TestContainsLetter
Enter a word and a letter 
computer b

b is not in computing.

or
$ java TestContainsLetter
Enter a word and a letter 
dog d

d is in dog.
Note that your method will actually be tested using the program below:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a word and a letter:");
        String word = input.next();
        String letters = input.next();
        
        String in = "";
        String notIn = "";
        for(int i = 0; i < letters.length(); i++)
            if(Word.containsLetter(word, letters.charAt(i)))
                in += letters.charAt(i);
            else
                notIn += letters.charAt(i); // add to list of letters 
        
        System.out.println(in + " are in " + word + ".");
        System.out.println(notIn + " are not in " + word + ".");
    }
}
