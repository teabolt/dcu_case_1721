Title: Show me the letters
Description: This time, you should write a showLetters method, which instead of taking one character, takes a string of characters representing a sequence of guesses and returns a new string with any guessed letters in their correct position and unguessed letters shown as underscores.Â 
For example, the method call:
Word.showLetters("computing", "gpo");
would display
_o_p____g
That is, any letters guessed are shown in their correct location and an underscore represents letters that are not guessed.

So, write a method called showLetters which takes as parameters two strings, 
word
 and 
guesses
 and returns a new string containing underscores representing every letter in 
word
 unless that letter is in 
guesses
.
The method should be a static method of a Word class and could be used as shown in the following program (see section in bold):


import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestShowLetters
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Ask the user for a word and some guesses
        System.out.print("Enter a word and some guesses: ");
        String word = in.next();
        String guesses = in.next();
        
        String show = 
Word.showLetters(word, guesses)
;
        System.out.println(show);
    }
}
And the program would be executed as follows:

$ java TestShowLetters
Enter a word and some guesses: 
computing gpo

_o_p____g
Note : Your method will actually be tested with the program below:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    // generate the alphabet
    static String getAlphabet()
    {
        String alphabet = "";
        for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
            alphabet += (char) ('a' + i);
            
        return alphabet;
    }
    
    static boolean contains(String word, char let)
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++)
            if(word.charAt(i) == let)
                return true;
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        String alphabet = getAlphabet();
        System.out.println("Enter a word:");
        String word = input.next();
        String guesses = "";    // Start with no guesses

        // 1. try every second letter in the alphabet
        for(int i = 0; i < alphabet.length(); i += 2)
            if(contains(word, alphabet.charAt(i)))
            {
                guesses += alphabet.charAt(i); // Try this letter
                System.out.println(Word.showLetters(word, guesses));
            }
            
        // 2. Try the same thing backwards
        guesses = ""; // reset guesses
        for(int i = alphabet.length() - 1; i >= 0; i -= 2)
            if(contains(word, alphabet.charAt(i)))
            {
                guesses += alphabet.charAt(i); // Try this letter
                System.out.println(Word.showLetters(word, guesses));
            }

        // 3. try no guesses (i.e. empty string)
        System.out.println(Word.showLetters(word, ""));

        // 4. all letters 
        for(int i = 0; i < alphabet.length(); i++)
            if(contains(word, alphabet.charAt(i)))
                guesses += alphabet.charAt(i); // Try this letter

        System.out.println(Word.showLetters(word, guesses));
    }
}

This code reads in a word and then tests your method in four different ways
