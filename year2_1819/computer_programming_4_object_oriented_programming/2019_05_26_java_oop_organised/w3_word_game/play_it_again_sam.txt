Title: Play it again Sam
Description: Write a rudimentary Hangman game. In this game, your program will present a word to the user who will guess a letter at a time. Your program will keep them informed of their progress by showing them which letters of the word are guessed.
The game might go something like this, with the user's guesses shown in bold.
$java Hangman
The word is
___
Guess a letter:

o

_o_
Guess a letter:

g

_og
Guess a letter:

e

_og
Guess a letter:

d

Well Done, the word was dog.

Note that when the user entered 'e', which doesn't appear in the word, he was just asked to guess again.
You should write your program in a Hangman class. You will be supplied with a Word class which contains the methods allDone() and showLetters() which are implementations of your earlier methods. There will also be a getWord() method which returns a word that the user is to guess.

using the allDone() method and the showLetters() methods that you wrote earlier. In addition, you will be supplied with a getWord() method which will return the word to be guessed.
Hints:


        int wordSeed = in.nextInt();

        String word = Word.getWord(wordSeed);

in.next().charAt(o)
sentence += let
