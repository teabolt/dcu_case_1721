Title: Show me the letter
Description: In a hangman game, when the player guesses a letter correctly, they are shown where the letter is in the word. For example, if the word is computer and the player guesses the letter 'm', then the player is shown:

__m_____
Write a method called showLetter which takes as parameters a 
word
 and a 
guess
 and returns a string containing underscores representing every letter in 
word
 unless that letter is 
guess
 in which case it shows the guessed letter..
The method should be a static method of a Word class and could be used as shown in the following program (see section in bold):


import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestFirstLetter
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Ask the user for a word and a letter
        System.out.print("Enter a word and a letter: ");
        String word = in.next();
        char guess = in.next().charAt(0);
        
        String show = 
Word.showLetter(word, guess)
;
        System.out.println(show);
    }
}
And the program would be executed as follows:

$ java TestShowLetter
Enter a word and a letter 
computer m

__m_____

or
$ java TestShowLetter
Enter a word and a letter 
better e

_e__e_
Note that in the second example, two 'e's are shown as 'e' occurs twice in "better".
Note 2: Your method will actually be tested with the program below:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a word:");
        String word = input.next();
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++)
            System.out.println(
Word.showLetter(word, word.charAt(i))
);
    }
}

This code goes through every letter in word and uses that as the guessed letter. It then invokes your method and prints the result for testing.
