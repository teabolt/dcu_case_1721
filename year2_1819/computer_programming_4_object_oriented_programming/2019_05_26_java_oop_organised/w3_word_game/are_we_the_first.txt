Title: Are we the first?
Description: Write a method called isFirstLetter which takes as parameters a word and a letter and returns true if the word starts with the letter and false if it doesn't.
The method should be a static method of a Word class and could be used as shown in the following program (see section in bold):


import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestFirstLetter
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Ask the user for a word and a letter
        System.out.print("Enter a word and a letter: ");
        String word = in.next();
        char letter = in.next().charAt(0);
        
        if(
Word.isFirstLetter(word, letter)
)
            System.out.println(letter + " is the first letter of " + word);
        else
            System.out.println(letter + " is not the first letter of " + word);
    }
}
And the program would be executed as follows:

$ java TestFirstLetter
Enter a word and a letter 
computer b

b is not the first letter of the word computing.

or
$ java TestFirstLetter
Enter a word and a letter 
dog d

d is the first letter of the word dog.
Note that your method will actually be tested using the program below:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a word and a letter:");
        String word = in.next();
        String letters = in.next();
        
        char first = 0;
        String notFirst = "";
        for(int i = 0; i < letters.length(); i++)
            if(Word.isFirstLetter(word, letters.charAt(i)))
                first = letters.charAt(i);
            else
                notFirst += letters.charAt(i); // add to list of letters 
        
        System.out.println(first + " is the first letter of " + word + ".");
        System.out.println(notFirst + " are not the first letter of " + word + ".");
    }
}
