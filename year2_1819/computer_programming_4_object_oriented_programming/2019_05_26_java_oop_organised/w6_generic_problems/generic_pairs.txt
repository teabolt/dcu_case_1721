Title: Generic Pairs
Description: Create a Pair class which will hold a pair of objects specified generically in such a way that the following main method will work
public class TestPair
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {		
       Pair<String,Integer> phoneNumber = new Pair<>("Bill's number", 1324);	
       System.out.println(phoneNumber);
       Pair<Double,Double> point = new Pair<>(3.14, 2.32);
       System.out.println(point);
   }
}
The Pair class will have a constructor and a toString method. The toString method should call the toString methods of the objects comprising the pair with a space between them.
Once the Pair class has been correctly written, the code above will produce the output below:
Bill's number 1324
3.14 2.32
