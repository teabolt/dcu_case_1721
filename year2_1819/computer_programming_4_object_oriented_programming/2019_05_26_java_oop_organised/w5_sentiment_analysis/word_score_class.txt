Title: Word Score Class
Description: Create a class called WordScore. The class should have two attributes, a string called word and an integer called score. There should be a constructor which takes one String parameter which initialises the word.
There should be one method called score() which takes string and returns an int. The string represents the review and is in the form of a score followed by a space and a sentence. The function should return the score if the word is contained in the sentence and should return -1 otherwise.
Your class will be checked with the following code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TestWordScore
{
    public static void main(String [] args) throws FileNotException
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter a word and a review.");
        
        String word = in.next();
        String review = in.nextLine();
        
        WordScore wordScore = new WordScore(word);
        
        if(wordScore.score(review) == -1)
            System.out.println(word + " does not appear in this review.");
        else
            System.out.println(word + " gets a score of " + wordScore.score(review) + ".");
    }
}
