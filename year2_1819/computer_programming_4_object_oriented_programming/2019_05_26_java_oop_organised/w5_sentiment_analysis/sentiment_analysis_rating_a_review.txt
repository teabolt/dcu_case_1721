Title: Sentiment Analysis: Rating a review
Description: Your program is now ready to read a movie review and make an educated guess as to its score. So, that is your task. Write a method called sentiment which takes as parameters an unrated review and the name of a file of movie reviews and return the rating of the review. You should make the method a static method of a class called Sentiment. Your method should return a double value which will be the rating of the review based on the file of reviews which your method will be given.
Work out the score of each word in the unrated review and get the average of all the words in the review. If a word has no score (because it hasn't appeared in any of the existing reviews), then it shouldn't be counted.
A simple way to test this is to create a file called reviews.txt which only contains one review, e.g.
3 This movie was super good.

Then call your function with the same review. It should get the same score.
System.out.println(Sentiment.sentiment("This movie was super good.", "reviews.txt"));

and so this code should print 3.0. Of course, your program should work for a file with an arbitrary number of lines.
