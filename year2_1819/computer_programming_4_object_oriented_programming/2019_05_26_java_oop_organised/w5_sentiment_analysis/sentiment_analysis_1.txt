Title: Sentiment Analysis 1
Description: Write a program which takes a word and a file name as the command line parameters and then finds out how many times the word appears in the file.
Then the program should run as follows:
$ java Senti1 happy reviews.txt
The word "happy" occurs 24 times.

In other words, your program will read the reviews file and print out how many reviews contain the word.
Hint: The following code can be used to read lines of the reviews.txt file:
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

public class Movies
{
    public static void main(String [] a) throws FileNotFoundException
    {
        File movieReviewFile = new File("reviews.txt");
        Scanner moveReviewScanner = new Scanner(movieReviewFile);
        while(moveReviewScanner.hasNext())
        {
            // Now you can read in a line with Scanner's nextLine() method and you can
            // read in an int with the nextInt() method.
        }
