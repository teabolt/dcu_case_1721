Title: All the Exceptions
Description: This time the cracked method may throw a variety of Runtime Exceptions: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException and ArithmeticException
public class Broken
{
   // method generates an exception
   public void cracked()
   {
      // This code generates one of three Runtime Errors. Your code should catch them.
      // Invisible code
   }
}

Your program must catch all three Exceptions and print out the corresponding Exception name.
Also, you should have a finally clause and print "Finally!" when you reach the finally clause.
public class Catch
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Broken broke = new Broken();

      System.out.println("Testing");

      // Modify the code to catch the exceptions generated by Broken.cracked().
      broke.cracked();
   }
}

Hint: You could just run the unmodified Catch program and see what it prints and what it should print, and then fix it accordingly. Note also that the cracked method prints out one line which starts with Excepting, so 
don't panic
 if you see that there.
