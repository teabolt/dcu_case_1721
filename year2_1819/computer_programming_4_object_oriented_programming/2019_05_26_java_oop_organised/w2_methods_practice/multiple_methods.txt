Title: Multiple Methods
Description: import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Ask the user to enter a number
        System.out.print("Enter two numbers: ");
        
        // Read in the number 
        int a = in.nextInt();
        int b = in.nextInt();
        
        // call the multiply method of the Product class.
        int result = 
Product.multiply(a, b);

        
        System.out.println(a + " times " + b + " is " + result);
    }
}
Note that you don't create any main method. Just the multiply method which will be called by another method.
If you get an error, it could be because
1. You didn't create a Product class.
2. The Product class didn't have a multiply method.
3. The multiply method wasn't public static.
4. The multiply method didn't have two int parameters and didn't return an int variable.
