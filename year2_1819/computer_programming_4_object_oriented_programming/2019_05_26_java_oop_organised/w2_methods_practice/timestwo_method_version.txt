Title: TimesTwo: Method version
Description: public class Helper
{
   public static int twoTimes(int num)
   {
      return num * 2;
   }
}
Helper.twoTimes(16)
You could assign this to an integer variable called x with the following assignment statement:
x = Helper.twoTimes(16);
Obviously your program would be simpler if you just multiplied by 2, but this is an exercise in using methods. You will get zero marks unless you use the method.
Example usage:
$ java TwoTimes
Enter a number: 
4

Times two is: 8
Hint: This requires a minor change to the original TwoTimes solution. Find where you calculated twice the number and replace that expression with the method call as indicated above.
If you spend longer than 5 minutes at this, you are doing it wrong.
