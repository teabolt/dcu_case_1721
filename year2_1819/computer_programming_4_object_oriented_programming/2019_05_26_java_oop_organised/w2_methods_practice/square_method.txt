Title: Square Method
Description: import java.util.Scanner;

public class SquareIt
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Ask the user to enter a number
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        
        // Read in the number 
        int num = in.nextInt();
        
        // call the square method of the Helper class to get num squared.
        int result = 
Numbers.square(num);

        
        System.out.println(num + " squared is " + result);
    }
}
Note that you don't create any main method. Just the square method which will be called by another method.
If you get an error, it could be because
1. You didn't create a Numbers class.
2. It didn't have a square method.
3. The square method wasn't public static.
4. The square method didn't have an int parameter and didn't return an int variable.
