Title: An Array of Students (1)
Description: The following code creates an array of students:
public class GroupStudents
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Student [] group = {
               new Student("John", 50),
               new Student("Abby", 40),
               new Student("Dylan", 20),
               new Student("Carl", 70),
               new Student("Maeve", 70),
               new Student("Chris", 44),
               new Student("James", 55),
               new Student("Anne", 63),
            };

      Test.print(group);
   }
}
A Student is defined as:
public class Student
{
   String name;
   int mark;

   public Student(String n, int m)
   {
      name = n;
      mark = m;
   }
}
You should create the method print in the Test class which will print out the names of all the students. The code is mostly given below:
public class Test
{
   public static void print(Student [] student)
   {
      for(int i = 0; i < student.length; i++)
         System.out.println(/* Insert your code here */);
   }
}

The program will be compiled using 
javac GroupStudents.java
 and run using 
java GroupStudents
 The output should be:
$ java GroupStudents 
John
Abby
Dylan
Carl
Maeve
Chris
James
Anne

Hints:
You are given most of the code for this exercise, so it should be quite easy. However, make sure that you understand how the three classes work together.
