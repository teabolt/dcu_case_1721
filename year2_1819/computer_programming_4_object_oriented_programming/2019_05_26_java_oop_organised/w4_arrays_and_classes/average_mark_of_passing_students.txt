Title: Average mark of passing students
Description: Write a method which finds the average mark of all students who have passed. Your should not consider the marks of any student who has failed.
Your program will be tested with code similar to the following:
public class GroupStudents
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Student [] group = {
               new Student("John", 50),
               new Student("Abby", 40),
               new Student("Dylan", 20),
            };

      double passingAverage = Test.getPassingAverage(group);
      System.out.println("The average mark of all students who passed is " + passingAverage);
   }
}
A Student is defined as:
public class Student
{
   private String name;
   private int mark;

   public Student(String n, int m)
   {
      name = n;
      mark = m;
   }

   public String getName()
   {
      return name;
   }

   public int getMark()
   {
      return mark;
   }
}
Create a Test class with one static method which takes an array of students and returns the average mark of all students who have passed.
The program will be compiled using 
javac GroupStudents.java
 and run using 
java GroupStudents
 The output should be:
$ java GroupStudents
The average mark of all students who passed is 45.0

Here, only two students have passed with marks of 50 and 40. The average of those two marks is 45.
Tests: 4 tests run/ 4 tests passed
Grade: 100
