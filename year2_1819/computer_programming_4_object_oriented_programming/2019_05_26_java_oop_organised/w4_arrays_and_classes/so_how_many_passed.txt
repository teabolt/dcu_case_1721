Title: So, how many passed?
Description: Write a method which counts how many students received a passing mark.
Your program will be tested with code similar to the following:
public class GroupStudents
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Student [] group = {
               new Student("John", 50),
               new Student("Abby", 40),
               new Student("Dylan", 20),
               new Student("Carl", 70),
               new Student("Maeve", 70),
               new Student("Chris", 46),
               new Student("James", 55),
               new Student("Anne", 63),
            };

      int numPassed = Test.numberPasses(group);
      System.out.println(numPassed + " students passed out of " + group.length);
      System.out.println("That is an " + 100.0 * numPassed / group.length + "% pass rate.");
   }
}
A Student is defined as:
public class Student
{
   private String name;
   private int mark;

   public Student(String n, int m)
   {
      name = n;
      mark = m;
   }

   public String getName()
   {
      return name;
   }

   public int getMark()
   {
      return mark;
   }
}
Provide a method to the Test class called numberPasses(). It will have one parameter, an array of Students. It will return the number of students who have received a mark of 40 or higher.
The program will be compiled using 
javac GroupStudents.java
 and run using 
java GroupStudents
 The output should be:
$ java GroupStudents
7 students passed out of 8
That is an 87.5% pass rate.

Tests: 2 tests run/ 2 tests passed
Grade: 100
