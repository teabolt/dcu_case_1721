Title: An Array of Students (2)
Description: This exercise is a slight modification on the previous exercise. This time, you need to print out the 
student marks
 instead of the names.
As before, the following code creates an array of students:
public class GroupStudents
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Student [] group = {
               new Student("John", 50),
               new Student("Abby", 40),
               new Student("Dylan", 20),
               new Student("Carl", 70),
               new Student("Maeve", 70),
               new Student("Chris", 46),
               new Student("James", 55),
               new Student("Anne", 63),
            };

      Test.print(group);
   }
}
A Student is defined as:
public class Student
{
   String name;
   int mark;

   public Student(String n, int m)
   {
      name = n;
      mark = m;
   }
}
You should create the method print in the Test class which will print out the marks of all the students.Â 
The program will be compiled using 
javac GroupStudents.java
 and run using 
java GroupStudents
 The output should be:
$ java GroupStudents 
50
40
20
70
70
46
55
63

Hints:
This is a straightforward modification of the previous exercise.
Tests: 1  test run/ 1  test passed
