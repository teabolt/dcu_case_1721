Title: Forty Somethings
Description: Print only the students whose mark is forty something, i.e. a mark between 40 and 49 inclusive. Your method should be called printForties.
Your program will be tested with code similar to the following:
public class GroupStudents
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Student [] group = {
               new Student("John", 50),
               new Student("Abby", 40),
               new Student("Dylan", 20),
               new Student("Carl", 70),
               new Student("Maeve", 70),
               new Student("Chris", 46),
               new Student("James", 55),
               new Student("Anne", 63),
            };

      Test.printForties(group);
   }
}
A Student is defined as:
public class Student
{
   private String name;
   private int mark;

   public Student(String n, int m)
   {
      name = n;
      mark = m;
   }

   public String getName()
   {
      return name;
   }

   public int getMark()
   {
      return mark;
   }
}
You should create the method print in the Test class which will print out the marks of all the students.Â 
The program will be compiled using 
javac GroupStudents.java
 and run using 
java GroupStudents
 The output should be:
$ java GroupStudents 
70 (Carl)
70 (Maeve)
55 (James)
63 (Anne)
