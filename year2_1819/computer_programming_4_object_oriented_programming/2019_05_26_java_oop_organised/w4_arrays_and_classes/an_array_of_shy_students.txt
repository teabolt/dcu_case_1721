Title: An Array of shy Students
Description: This time the Student class is defined differently. The mark and name fields are private so that you can't access them directly. Now, you must use the getName() amd getMark() accessor (AKA getter) methods. Modify your print method so that it uses the accessor methods.
A Student is defined as:
public class Student
{
   private String name;
   private int mark;

   public Student(String n, int m)
   {
      name = n;
      mark = m;
   }

   public String getName()
   {
      return name;
   }

   public int getMark()
   {
      return mark;
   }
}
As before, the class that creates the array is similar to
public class GroupStudents
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Student [] group = {
               new Student("John", 50),
               new Student("Abby", 40),
               new Student("Dylan", 20),
               new Student("Carl", 70),
               new Student("Maeve", 70),
               new Student("Chris", 46),
               new Student("James", 55),
               new Student("Anne", 63),
            };

      Test.print(group);
   }
}
The program will be compiled using 
javac GroupStudents.java
 and run using 
java GroupStudents
 The output should be:
$ java GroupStudents 
50 (John)
40 (Abby)
20 (Dylan)
70 (Carl)
70 (Maeve)
46 (Chris)
55 (James)
63 (Anne)

Hint: if you get an error about private access:
error: name has private access in Student

it is because you are trying to access the mark or name directly. You need to use the assessor methods.
