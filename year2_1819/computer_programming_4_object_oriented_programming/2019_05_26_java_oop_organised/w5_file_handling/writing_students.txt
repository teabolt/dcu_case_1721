Title: Writing Students
Description: In this exercise, you read in a set of students from a file. Then you increase each student's mark by 1 and write out the results out to another file. The format of the file will be the same as in the previous exercise. The name of the input file will be the first argument and the name of the output file will be the second argument.
For example, if the input file was:
2
John 50
Abby 40

Your program will create the following file:
2
John 51
Abby 41

Note that the marks have been increased by 1
The program will be compiled using 
javac WriteStudents.java
 and run using 
java WriteStudents
 The output should be:
$ java GroupStudents students.in students.out

The program doesn't produce any output to the screen. Instead it creates an output file. In this case, the output file is called students.out (note the second parameter on the command line).
Tests: 1  test run/ 1  test passed
Grade: 100
