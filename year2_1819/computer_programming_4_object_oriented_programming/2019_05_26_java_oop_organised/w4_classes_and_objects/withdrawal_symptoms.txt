Title: Withdrawal Symptoms
Description: Add a withdraw method to your BankAccount class. It will represent a withdrawal from your account and so the balance should be reduced appropriately. The method will return nothing and so should have a return type of void.
Your BankAccount class will be tested by the following program:
public class TestBankAccount
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      BankAccount currentAccount = new BankAccount(10000.00);

      System.out.println("The balance is " + currentAccount.balance);

      currentAccount.withdraw(100.00);

      System.out.println("The balance is " + currentAccount.balance);
   }
}
The program will be compiled using 
javac TestBankAccount.java
 and run using 
java TestBankAccount
 The output should be:
$ java TestBankAccount 
The balance is 10000.0
The balance is 9900.0
