Title: Setters and getters
Description: Add a setter and a getter to your BankAccount class. These methods should set and retrive the balance value appropriately.
Your BankAccount class will be tested by the following program:
public class TestBankAccount
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      BankAccount account = new BankAccount(); // This uses the 
default constructor
.

      account.setBalance(650.00);
      System.out.println(account.getBalance());
      account.withdraw(25);

      System.out.println(account.getBalance());
   }
}
The program will be compiled using 
javac TestBankAccount.java
 and run using 
java TestBankAccount
 The output should be:
$java TestBankAccount 
650.0
625.0

Hints:
Probably the best hint is to check the notes on the toString method. Also, this method needs to be public.
Tests: 1  test run/ 1  test passed
