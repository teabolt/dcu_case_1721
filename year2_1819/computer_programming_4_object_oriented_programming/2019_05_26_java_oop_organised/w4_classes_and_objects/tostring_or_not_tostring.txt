Title: toString or not toString
Description: Add a toString method to your BankAccount class. It should return a string representing the account. The string should be exactly
The balance is 
followed by the balance.
Your BankAccount class will be tested by the following program:
public class TestBankAccount
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      BankAccount account = new BankAccount(); // This uses the 
default constructor
.

      System.out.println(account);
      account.withdraw(25);

      System.out.println(account);
   }
}
The program will be compiled using 
javac TestBankAccount.java
 and run using 
java TestBankAccount
 The output should be:
$java TestBankAccount 
The balance is 100.0
The balance is 75.0

Hints:
Probably the best hint is to check the notes on the toString method. Also, this method needs to be public.
