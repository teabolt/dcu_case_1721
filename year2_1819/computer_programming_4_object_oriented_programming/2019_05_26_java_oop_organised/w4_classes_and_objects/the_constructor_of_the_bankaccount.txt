Title: The Constructor of the BankAccount
Description: Add a constructor to 
the BankAccount class
. It should take a single parameter of type double which will be used to initialise the balance of the account.

The BankAccount class
 will be tested by the following program:
public class TestBankAccount
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      BankAccount currentAccount = new BankAccount(10000.00);

      System.out.println("The balance is " + currentAccount.balance);
   }
}
The program will be compiled using 
javac TestBankAccount.java
 and run using 
java TestBankAccount
 The output should be:
$ java TestBankAccount 
The balance is 10000.0

Hints:
Probably the best hint is to check the notes on constructors.
