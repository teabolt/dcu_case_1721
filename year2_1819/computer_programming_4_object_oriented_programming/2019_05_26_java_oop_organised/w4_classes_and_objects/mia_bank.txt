Title: MIA Bank
Description: The MIA Bank has a special offer for all new accounts. It sets the initial balance to 100.00. Add a default (no args) constructor for the MIA bank which initialises the balance to 100.00. You should leave the existing constructor in place. Your class should have two constructors.
Your BankAccount class will be tested by the following program:
public class TestBankAccount
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      BankAccount account1 = new BankAccount(); // This uses the 
default constructor
.
      BankAccount account2 = new BankAccount(900); // This uses one argument constructor.

      System.out.println("Account 1 has " + account1.balance);

      System.out.println("Account 2 has " + account2.balance);
   }
}
The program will be compiled using 
javac TestBankAccount.java
 and run using 
java TestBankAccount
 The output should be:
$ java TestBankAccount 
Account 1 has 100.0
Account 2 has 900.0

Hints:
Probably the best hint is to check the notes on default constructors.
Tests: 1  test run/ 1  test passed
