Title: The BankAccount class
Description: Create a BankAccount class. You will need to create a file called BankAccount.java which contains your class. It should have one field called balance which will represent the current balance of the account. The balance should be represented by a double type. Your class need only contain this one field. It doesn't need any constructors or methods. Your class will be tested by the following program:
public class TestBankAccount
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      BankAccount currentAccount = new BankAccount();

      currentAccount.balance = 60.05;

      System.out.println("The balance is " + currentAccount.balance);

      currentAccount.balance = currentAccount.balance + 10;

      System.out.println("The balance is " + currentAccount.balance);
   }
}
The program will be compiled using 
javac TestBankAccount.java
 and run using 
java TestBankAccount
 The output should be:
$ java TestBankAccount 
The balance is 60.05
The balance is 70.05
