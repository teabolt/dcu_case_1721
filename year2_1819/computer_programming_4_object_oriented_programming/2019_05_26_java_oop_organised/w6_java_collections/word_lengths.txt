Title: Word Lengths
Description: Write a program which will read in a series of words and then then print out the number of times a word of each length occurs. For example, if the program was run as follows:
java WordLength

this sent ence cont ains only four lett errr words

4: 9
5: 1

In this case, the "sentence" contained 9 four letter "words" and one five letter word (namely words). Use a map to map each word length onto a number. Note that in practice, you could use an ArrayList for this because the keys are relatively small numbers, but we are doing maps, so use a map.
Here is another more cultured example
java WordLength

If music be the food of love, play on
Give me excess of it; that surfeiting
The appetite may sicken, and so die

2: 7
3: 6
4: 4
5: 2
6: 1
7: 1
8: 1
10: 1

Note that the input had seven words of length 2.
