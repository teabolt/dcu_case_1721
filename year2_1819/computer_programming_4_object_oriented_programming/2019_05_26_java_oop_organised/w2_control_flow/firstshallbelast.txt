Title: FirstShallBeLast
Description: Write a static method for a Test class called firstShallBeLast which takes a string, swaps the first and last characters and returns this string.
Your method will be called by another Java class as follows:
public class main
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      String s = "abcdef";
      String newString = Test.firstShallBeLast(s);
      System.out.println("Test.firstShallBeLast(" + s + ") is " + newString);
   }
}

This program would print:
Test.firstShallBeLast(abcdef) is fbcdea
Note that the first character, 'a', has been swapped with the last, 'f'.
Tests: 4 tests run/ 4 tests passed
