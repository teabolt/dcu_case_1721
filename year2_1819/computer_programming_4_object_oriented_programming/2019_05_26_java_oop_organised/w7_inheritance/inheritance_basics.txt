Title: Inheritance (Basics)
Description: The following program consists of three Java source files and does nothing. It doesn't even compile. The files are Main.java, Parent.java and Child.java
Here is Main.java
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String []args)
	{
		Parent x = new Child();
	}
}

Here is Parent.java (an empty class - not useful except for this exercise)
public class Parent
{
}

Here is Child.java (
an empty class - not useful except for this exercise
)
public class Child
{
}

Modify only the Child class so that the program compiles. Obviously, you have to make the 
 type of Child 
compatible with 
the type of Parent
. You should do this using inheritance.
