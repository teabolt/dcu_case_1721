Title: Odd That
Description: Read in a whole number and determine if it is odd or even. Note that the modulus operator gives us the remainder when we perform integer division, that is 15 % 4 will give us the remainder which is left after we divide 15 by 4 (which is 3).
Now, use 
the if statement
 along with the modulus operator and determine a number is even or odd.
Example usage:
$ java EvenOdd
Enter a number: 
6

6 is even.
or
$ java EvenOdd
Enter a number: 
9

9 is odd.
