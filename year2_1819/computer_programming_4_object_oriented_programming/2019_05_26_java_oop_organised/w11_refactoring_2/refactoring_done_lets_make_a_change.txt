Title: Refactoring done: Let's make a change
Description: Up til now, we have been modifying the code even though the new code behaved exactly as the old code did. Once we have refactored properly, we should be able to make changes to the code quite easily.
In this case, you are asked to double the price of the Regular Movies. You will have to modify one file, RegularPrice.java. Modify the code appropriately. The change will be very simple.
Your class will be tested with the following programs:
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Movie [] movies = { new Movie("James Bond does Java", Price.NEW_RELEASE), new Movie("Mickey Mouse", Price.CHILDRENS), new Movie("The Pointer Sisters", Price.REGULAR)};
        
        boolean ok = true;
        
        int next = 0;
        Movie m;
        m = movies[next++];
        if(m.price.getPriceCode() != Price.NEW_RELEASE)
        {
            System.out.println("1. Price code is not correct");
            ok = false;
        }
        m = movies[next++];
        if(m.price.getPriceCode() != Price.CHILDRENS)
        {
            System.out.println("2. Price code is not correct");
            ok = false;
        }
        m = movies[next++];
        if(m.price.getPriceCode() != Price.REGULAR)
        {
            System.out.println("3. Price code is not correct");
            ok = false;
        }
        // Now, see if the setPriceCode works
        m.setPriceCode(Price.CHILDRENS);
        if(m.price.getPriceCode() != Price.CHILDRENS)
        {
            System.out.println("4. Price code is not correct");
            ok = false;
        }
        m.setPriceCode(Price.NEW_RELEASE);
        if(m.price.getPriceCode() != Price.NEW_RELEASE)
        {
            System.out.println("5. Price code is not correct");
            ok = false;
        }
        m.setPriceCode(Price.REGULAR);
        if(m.price.getPriceCode() != Price.REGULAR)
        {
            System.out.println("6. Price code is not correct");
            ok = false;
        }
        if(ok)
            System.out.println("All Korrect.");
    }
}
