Title: Add the getCharge() method to Price polymorphically
Description: Create an abstract getCharge() method for the Price class and also add appropriate getCharge() methods to each of its subclasses. Remember that the getCharge() method will need to know the number of days.
Your class should work with the following program
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Price cp = new ChildrensPrice();
        Price nrp = new NewReleasePrice();
        Price reg = new RegularPrice();
        
        boolean ok = true;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
            System.out.print(cp.getCharge(i) + " ");
        System.out.println();
        for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
            System.out.print(nrp.getCharge(i) + " ");
        System.out.println();
        for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
            System.out.print(reg.getCharge(i) + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
}
