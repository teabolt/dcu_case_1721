Title: Ordering Items
Description: For many algorithms you need to be able to compare things. For example, if you want to sort a list of items, you need to have some way of telling whether one item is smaller than another. You can write a method to compare two items and you need your sorting algorithm to be able to know that such a method exists. This is where interfaces are most useful.
Here is the Point class
public class Point
{
    private double x, y;
    
    public Point(double newX, double newY)
    {
        x = newX;
        y = newY;
    }
    
    public String toString()
    {
        return "(" + x + ", " + y + ")";
    }
}
Here is an Order interface
public interface Order
{
    public boolean lessThan(Order other);
}

Modify the Point class so that it properly implements the Order interface. Two Points will be compared by first checking the x coordinate. Whichever Point has the smaller x coordinate, then that Point will be regarded as being smaller. If the two x coordinates are the same, then use the y coordinate as a decider.
The Main.java and Order.java files are supplied.
Your program will be compiled using the following command:
javac Main.java
and run using
java Main
and here is the Main.java file:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static Point getPoint(Scanner in)
    {
        double x = in.nextDouble(), y = in.nextDouble();
        return new Point(x, y);
    }
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        Point p1 = getPoint(in);
        Point p2 = getPoint(in);
        
        System.out.println("p1 = " + p1);
        System.out.println("p2 = " + p2);
        System.out.println("p1.lessThan(p2) = " + p1.lessThan(p2));
    }
}
Your Point class will need to implement the Order Interface which means that you will have to provide a
Â lessThan method. The less than method will have to compare the current point with another (called other). You need to cast this to a Point so that you can extract the x and y values and compare them so that you can say whether it is less than or not.
