Title: Creation
Description: public class Date
{
   private int day;
   private int month;
   private int year;

   public toString()
   {
      return day + "/" + month + "/" + year;
   }
}
This class obviously needs a constructor. Create a constructor which takes three integer values and initialises the date appropriately. Once you have written the constructor, the following code should work:
Date bigBomb = new Date(6, 8, 1945);
System.out.println(bigBomb);
