Title: Period
Description: 10:00 -> 12:00
Your class will look like the following
public class Period
{
   // Private variables
   // Constructor (with two Time parameters)
   // overlaps(Period otherPeriod) // boolean method to check if two periods overlap
   // Think carefully about the overlap condition. Use the isLater method of time.
   // It might help if you draw diagrams
   // String toString() // return a String representation of the Period
}
Your class will be tested in a method similar to the following
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
      String line1 = in.nextLine();
      String line2 = in.nextLine();

      Time time1 = new Time(line1);
      Time time2 = new Time(line2);
      Period p1 = new Period(time1, time2);
      System.out.println("Period 1 is " + p1);


      // Read a new set of times
      line1 = in.nextLine();
      line2 = in.nextLine();

      time1 = new Time(line1);
      time2 = new Time(line2);

      Period p2 = new Period(time1, time2);

      System.out.println("Period 2 is " + p2);
      if(p1.overlaps(p2))
         System.out.println("They overlap");
      else
         System.out.println("They do not overlap");
   }
}
