Title: Type Errors
Description: Given the same Cat class, Polite interface and main method from the previous exercise, remove the implements statement from the Cat class to generate an error as follows:
Main.java:5: error: incompatible types

Note that this is a trivially easy exercise. If you take longer than 2 minutes at it, then you haven't read the description properly.
