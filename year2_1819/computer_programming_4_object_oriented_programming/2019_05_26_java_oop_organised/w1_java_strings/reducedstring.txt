Title: ReducedString
Description: java ReducedString
Enter a string: 
3 Goodie!

Gooie!

Note that counting starts at 0 and so the the character at position 3 is the 'd'. That character has been removed.
Here is another example:
java ReducedString
Enter a string: 
0 ABC

BC

Position 0 is the first character of the string, the "A" which is removed.
Yet another example
java ReducedString
Enter a string: 
1 ABC

AC

This time, the second letter (at position 1) is removed.
Yet another example
java ReducedString
Enter a string: 
2 ABC

AB

This time, the third letter (at position 2) is removed.
Remember that with the string "ABC" the letter positions are as shown below:
ABC
012
Hint: When you are testing your program, you could use the string "01234567" because then the numbers correspond to the position in the string.
