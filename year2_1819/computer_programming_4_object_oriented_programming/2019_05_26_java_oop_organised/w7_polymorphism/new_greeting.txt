Title: New Greeting
Description: Hello
, my name is 
name


Where Hello is species specific, that is a dog would say "woof" and a cat would say "Meow". Name has the usual meaning. You will only have to change the Animal class. Otherwise, the code will be the same as for the previous exercise.
Your code will be checked by the following program:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static Animal [] makeSomeNoise()
    {
        Animal [] animals = {new Cat("Angel"), new Cat("Cheesire"), new Dog("Buster"), new Dog("Fido"), new Cat("Lassie")};
        return animals;
    }

    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        Animal [] animals = makeSomeNoise();
        for(Animal animal : animals)
            System.out.println(animal.greeting());
    }
}
which, when run, should print:
Meow, my name is Angel
Meow, my name is Cheesire
Woof, my name is Buster
Woof, my name is Fido
Meow, my name is Lassie
