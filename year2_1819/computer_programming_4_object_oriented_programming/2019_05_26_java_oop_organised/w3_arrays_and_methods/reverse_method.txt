Title: Reverse Method
Description: Write a static method which has an array parameter and which reverses an integer array. Put the method in a Test class
Your method would be called as follows
   int [] num = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17};
   // Call the method to reverse the array
   Test.reverse(num);

Your method should not print anything. It will be called by the following program:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        // Create a scanner object
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("How many numbers: ");
        int len = in.nextInt();
        
        int [] num = new int[len];
        System.out.print("Enter " + len + " numbers: ");
        for(int i = 0; i < num.length; i++)
            num[i] = in.nextInt();
            
        Test.reverse(num);

        System.out.print("The numbers reversed are:");
        for(int i = 0; i < num.length; i++)
            System.out.print(" " + num[i]);
            
        System.out.println();
    }
}

This program will read in the array and use your method to reverse the array. Then it will print out the result.
