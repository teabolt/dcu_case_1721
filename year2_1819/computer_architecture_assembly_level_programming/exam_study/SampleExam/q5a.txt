q5(a)
Answer goes here
Pass parameters to procedures via:
1. Registers
Advantages: 
Simple, 
fast,
create a "scope" within the procedure. // all registers can be backed up, no destruction
Disadvantages: 
Need backups or pre-call register values get destroyed, 
limited number of registers, 
data amount limited to register size.	// limited to the data bus? RAM / stack would be equivalently limited?

2. RAM / memory locations
Advantages:
Plenty of RAM,
can pass more data.
Disadvantages:
Slower, // move data to register, move data to memory, move data out of memory to register ...
need to keep track of "allocated" memory locations for procedure parameters,
act as "global" variables that can be modified from anywhere - might not be a good idea.

3. The Stack
Advantages:
Fast, // (1 instruction)
large. // a lot of data can be passed
// architecture supports the stack by default
// optimal for recursion
// real life scenario
Disadvantages:
Some mad tricks required to bypass the IP saved at the top from making the call in order to actually get to the parameters (or is it just me???), // no - just pop the address to a register (will be destroyed) and push at the end (this is required - drawback?)
Stack may grow a lot, putting in danger other code. // stack-threatened code area
// need to keep the stack balanced to return to the right place
