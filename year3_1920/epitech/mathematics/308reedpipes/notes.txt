Technical terms:
Absicassa - x coordinate in (x, y). Horizontal distance.
Reed pipe - pipe instrument
Curve interpolation - drawing a curve through a discrete set of points, to be able to pick any point between the set of original points
Spline - an interpolation method (how to draw a curve), using a piecewise polynomial function
Piecewise function - function with subfunctions over certain intervals (like if statements)
Newton's method - (optimization) find roots of a differentiable function i.e. f'(x) derivative

The problem:
Having 5 known points (r0, r5, r10, r15, r20), interpolate to know n points.
And display some intermediary vector.

About splines:

Spline interpolation - using spline functions as the interpolant. Preferred over polynomial interpolation due to error reasons.
Spline - used to be elastic ruler that is bent to pass through a number of points, used for technical drawings.
Cubic spline - type of spline with degree 3 terms

Spline function = a piecewise polynomial function.
maps interval [a,b] to R set.
[a,b] is split into k ordered (in ascending order) disjoint (non-overlapping) subintervals.
For each subinterval, define a polynomial function mapping the subinterval to R set.
The Spline function is defined as piecewise with each polynomial on their subinterval, where the left is included but the left is excluded.

Knots = the splitting points of the interval.
The knot vector t = vector of the splitting points.
Uniform spline = knots are equidistantly distributed.
Spline degree = maximum degree of all the polynomials.
Ck = differentiability class of a function. Means that the function has derivatives from 0 to k AND the derivatives are continuous/differentiable.
Smooth = class C(inf) function - derivatives of all orders are continuous.
Smoothness vector r = vector of differentiability classes (their orders) for all knots of the spline except for the endpoints.
Loss of smoothness = when two polynomials connect next to each other, the loss of smoothness is at most (degree-smoothness vector entry at the point of meeting).

Polynomials share derivative values at the point they connect, from derivative order 0 to order indicated by smoothness vector.

Extended knot vector = knot vector with multiple knots repeated. Can characterize a spline together with the degree.
Natural cubic spline = spline with degree 3, continuity C2, and S''(a)=S''(b)=0 (2nd derivatives are set to zero at the endpoints, meaning spline is straight outside the interval).
